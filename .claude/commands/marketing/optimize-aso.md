# Optimize App Store Presence (ASO)

I need you to optimize our app store listing to increase organic downloads and improve conversion rates.

## Context

**Platform**: $ARGUMENTS

(Examples: "iOS App Store", "Google Play Store", "Both iOS and Android", "New app launch", "Existing app with declining downloads")

## Your Task

Route this to the **app-store-optimizer** agent who will:

1. **Current State Audit**:
   - App name and subtitle/short description
   - Keywords currently ranking for
   - Current conversion rate (impressions → downloads)
   - Competitor analysis (top 5-10 apps in category)
   - Review sentiment (star rating, common themes)
   - Download trends (daily, weekly, monthly)

2. **Keyword Research & Optimization**:
   **iOS App Store**:
   - App Name (30 characters): [Brand] - [Primary Keyword]
   - Subtitle (30 characters): [Value prop with 2-3 keywords]
   - Keyword Field (100 characters): Comma-separated, no spaces
     - Focus on high-volume, low-competition keywords
     - Use keyword tools (AppTweak, Sensor Tower, App Radar)
   - Localization: Repeat for each target market (different keywords per language)

   **Google Play Store**:
   - Title (50 characters): [Brand] - [Primary Keywords]
   - Short Description (80 characters): [Hook + value prop]
   - Long Description (4000 characters):
     - First 250 chars most important (shown before "Read more")
     - Natural keyword placement (avoid stuffing)
     - Feature bullets with benefits
     - Social proof and awards

   **Keyword Strategy**:
   - Primary keywords (high volume, moderate competition)
   - Long-tail keywords (lower volume, high intent)
   - Competitor keywords (rank for competitor brand names)
   - Semantic variations (synonyms, related terms)

3. **Visual Asset Optimization**:
   **App Icon**:
   - Simple, recognizable at small sizes
   - No text (or minimal, large font)
   - Contrasting colors (stand out in search results)
   - A/B test 2-3 variations

   **Screenshots** (iOS: 10 max, Android: 8 max):
   - First 2-3 are critical (shown before scrolling)
   - Portrait orientation (9:16 aspect ratio)
   - Add captions/text overlays (highlight key features)
   - Show app in action (not just splash screens)
   - Feature progression: Hook → Core features → Social proof

   **Screenshot Formula**:
   1. Hero shot (main value prop + visual)
   2. Feature 1 (most important use case)
   3. Feature 2 (differentiation from competitors)
   4. Social proof (ratings, testimonials, press)
   5. Feature 3+ (additional benefits)

   **Preview Video** (iOS: 3 videos max, Android: 1 video):
   - First 3 seconds: Hook (show problem or amazing result)
   - 15-30 seconds total (shorter is better)
   - No sound required (add captions)
   - Show app interface, not actors or talking heads
   - End with clear CTA

4. **Description Copywriting**:
   **First 250 Characters** (critical, shown before "Read more"):
   ```
   [Hook: Problem or bold claim]
   [Value proposition: What makes you different]
   [Social proof: Users, rating, or achievement]
   [CTA: "Download now to..."]
   ```

   **Feature Bullets** (use emoji for scannability):
   - ✅ Benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
   - 5-8 bullets max
   - Start with action verbs
   - Include keywords naturally

   **Social Proof Section**:
   - ⭐ "Rated 4.8/5 by 10,000+ users"
   - 🏆 Awards and press mentions
   - 📈 "Join 100,000+ users who..."

5. **Conversion Rate Optimization**:
   **A/B Testing** (iOS Product Page Optimization, Android Experiments):
   - Test icon variations (3 variations)
   - Test screenshot order and captions
   - Test video vs no video
   - Measure: Conversion rate (impressions → installs)

   **iOS Specific**:
   - Product Page Optimization (PPO): Test up to 3 variations
   - Custom Product Pages: Create pages for different audiences/campaigns

   **Android Specific**:

   - Track sentiment over time (categorize issues)

7. **Localization Strategy**:
   - Prioritize markets: Start with English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese
   - Translate everything: Name, description, keywords, screenshots
   - Culturally adapt: Use local social proof, adapt visuals
   - Keyword research per market (different search behavior)

8. **Category & Metadata**:
   - Primary category: [Most relevant, highest volume]
   - Secondary category (iOS): [Broader or niche category]
   - Age rating: [Set appropriately, lower is better for reach]
