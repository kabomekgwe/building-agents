# TikTok Growth Strategy

I need you to create a TikTok content strategy to grow followers and drive conversions.

## Context

**Current State**: $ARGUMENTS

(Examples: "0 followers, brand new account", "5k followers, engagement dropping", "Launching new product, need viral content", "B2B SaaS, want to reach developers")

## Your Task

Route this to the **tiktok-strategist** agent who will:

1. **Account Audit & Setup**:
   - Profile optimization:
     - Username (memorable, searchable)
     - Bio (value prop in 80 characters)
     - Link strategy (Linktree, direct landing page)
     - Profile picture (brand logo or face)
   - Content audit (if existing account):
     - Top-performing videos analysis
     - Engagement rate trends
     - Follower growth patterns
     - Drop-off points (where viewers leave)

2. **Niche & Audience Research**:
   - Define content pillars (3-5 core themes)
   - Target audience demographics (age, interests, pain points)
   - Competitor analysis (5-10 similar accounts):
     - What's working for them?
     - Content gaps to exploit
     - Differentiation strategy
   - Trending sounds and hashtags in your niche

3. **Content Strategy**:
   **Hook-First Approach** (first 3 seconds critical):
   - Pattern interrupts ("Stop scrolling if...", "POV:", "This is your sign...")
   - Bold statements or questions
   - Visual hooks (text overlays, fast cuts)

   **Video Formats** (rotate for variety):
   - Educational/Tutorial (how-to, tips, hacks)
   - Behind-the-scenes (process, team, workspace)
   - Trending challenges (adapt to your niche)
   - Storytelling (customer stories, founder journey)
   - Product demos (features, use cases)
   - Myth-busting (common misconceptions)
   - Reactions/Stitches (engage with trending content)

   **Optimal Specs**:
   - Duration: 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 21-34s)
   - Aspect ratio: 9:16 vertical
   - Captions: Always (80% watch without sound)
   - Posting times: Test 6-9am, 12-3pm, 7-10pm (local time)

4. **Viral Growth Tactics**:
   - **Trending Audio**: Use sounds with < 100k uses (early trend adoption)
   - **Hashtag Strategy**: 3-5 per video
     - 1-2 broad (#fyp, #foryou)
     - 2-3 niche (#indiehackers, #saastips)
     - 1 branded (#YourBrandName)
   - **Engagement Bait** (use sparingly):
     - "Comment X if you want Y"
     - "Duet this with your version"
     - "Which one? 👇" (encourage comments)
   - **Series Content**: "Part 1 of 5" (binge-watching effect)
   - **Collaborations**: Duets, stitches, shoutouts with similar accounts

5. **Posting Schedule**:
   - Frequency: 3-5 videos per day (TikTok rewards consistency)
   - Batch creation: Film 10-15 videos in one session
   - Content calendar: Plan 2 weeks ahead
   - Evergreen content: 70% (always relevant)
   - Trending content: 30% (ride viral waves)

6. **Growth Acceleration**:
   - **First Hour Critical**: Respond to ALL comments in first 60 minutes
   - **Community Engagement**: Spend 1 hour daily engaging on others' content
     - Comment on videos in your niche
     - Follow accounts that follow competitors
     - Engage with followers' content
   - **Cross-Promotion**:
     - Repurpose top TikToks to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
     - Tease TikTok content in other channels
     - Embed TikToks in blog posts/newsletters

7. **Monetization & Conversion**:
   - Drive to link in bio (use Linktree for multiple CTAs)
   - Soft CTAs in captions ("Link in bio for more")
   - Creator Marketplace (brand deals once 10k+ followers)
   - TikTok Shop integration (if applicable)
   - Affiliate links (subtle, value-first)

8. **Analytics & Optimization**:
   **Key Metrics** (check daily):
   - Video views (target: 1000+ in first hour)
   - Engagement rate: (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views (target: > 5%)
   - Average watch time (target: > 50%)
   - Follower growth rate
   - Traffic to link in bio

   **Optimization Rules**:
   - If watch time < 30%, shorten videos or improve hook
   - If engagement < 3%, test different CTAs or questions
   - If views plateau, switch content format or trending audio
   - Double down on video formats with > 10% engagement

## Deliverables

- 30-day content calendar (3-5 videos/day = 90-150 video ideas)
- Video script templates for each content pillar
