# Run Studio Work Session

I need you to organize and facilitate a focused studio work session for rapid, high-quality output.

## Context

**Session Goal**: $ARGUMENTS

(Examples: "Design sprint for new feature", "Bug bash session", "Content creation sprint", "Quarterly planning session", "Brainstorm new product ideas")

## Your Task

Route this to the **studio-producer** agent who will:

1. **Session Planning**:
   **Define Session Type**:
   - **Design Sprint** (1-5 days): Solve problem, prototype, test
   - **Build Sprint** (2-3 days): Ship complete feature end-to-end
   - **Content Sprint** (1 day): Batch-create content (blog posts, videos, social)
   - **Bug Bash** (half-day): Find and fix bugs rapidly
   - **Brainstorm** (2-4 hours): Generate ideas, prioritize
   - **Planning** (half-day): Roadmap, OKRs, sprint planning

   **Session Duration**:
   - Deep work block: 90-120 minutes (before fatigue sets in)
   - Breaks: 15 minutes every 90 minutes
   - Half-day session: 4 hours total
   - Full-day session: 8 hours (with lunch break)
   - Multi-day sprint: 2-5 days

   **Participants**:
   - Core team: [roles needed, e.g., designer, engineer, product manager]
   - Optional: [stakeholders for reviews, users for testing]
   - Facilitator: [person running the session]
   - Note-taker: [documenting decisions and output]

2. **Pre-Session Preparation** (1-2 days before):
   **Agenda & Materials**:
   - Session goal (clear, specific)
   - Agenda with time blocks:
     ```
     9:00-9:30   Kickoff & alignment
     9:30-11:00  Deep work block 1
     11:00-11:15 Break
     11:15-12:45 Deep work block 2
     12:45-13:00 Wrap-up & next steps
     ```
   - Pre-reads (context docs, user research, data)
   - Tools ready (Figma, Miro, code editor, staging environment)

   **Environment Setup**:
   - Dedicated space (physical room or virtual meeting)
   - No interruptions (phones off, Slack snoozed)
   - Materials (whiteboards, sticky notes, markers)
   - Snacks and drinks (physical sessions)
   - Music (optional, for deep work)

   **Participant Preparation**:
   - Share agenda 24 hours before
   - Assign pre-work (read docs, review designs, think about problem)
   - Confirm attendance and availability
   - Set expectations (full focus, no multitasking)

3. **Session Formats by Type**:

   ### **Design Sprint** (Google Ventures style, 5-day version):

   ### **Build Sprint** (2-3 days):
   **Day 1: Plan & Design**
   - Define feature scope (what's in, what's out)
   - Technical design (architecture, data model)
   - UI design (wireframes, mockups)
   - Break into tasks

   **Afternoon: Polish & Schedule**
   - Edit and refine
   - Create visuals (graphics, thumbnails)
   - SEO optimization (if applicable)
   - Schedule publishing (content calendar)

   ### **Bug Bash** (half-day):
   **Hour 1: Setup**
   - Define scope (what to test)
   - Assign areas (each person takes a feature)
   - Create shared bug log (Notion, Linear, Jira)

   **Hour 2-3: Find Bugs**
   - Exploratory testing (break things)
   - Document bugs (steps to reproduce, screenshots)
   - Severity classification (P0, P1, P2)

   **Hour 4: Triage & Fix**
   - Review all bugs found
   - Prioritize by severity
   - Assign owners
   - Fix P0 bugs immediately

   ### **Brainstorm** (2-4 hours):
   **Phase 1: Diverge (generate ideas)**
   - Silent brainstorming (everyone writes ideas individually)
   - Round-robin sharing (everyone presents)
   - Build on others' ideas ("Yes, and...")
   - No criticism (quantity over quality)

   **Phase 2: Converge (prioritize ideas)**
   - Dot voting (each person gets 3-5 votes)
   - Group similar ideas
   - Discuss top ideas (pros, cons, feasibility)
   - Rank by impact × effort

   **Phase 3: Action Plan**
   - Top 3 ideas to pursue
   - Owners and next steps
   - Timeline and milestones

4. **Facilitation Techniques**:
   **Timeboxing**:
   - Use timer for each activity (Pomodoro technique)
   - Announce time remaining ("10 minutes left")
   - Move on even if incomplete (momentum > perfection)

   **Decision-Making**:
   - Dot voting (each person votes on favorites)
   - Decider (one person has final say, usually product owner)
   - Fist to five (1 = disagree, 5 = strongly agree)
   - Async voting (Google Forms, Slack poll)

   **Engagement Tactics**:
   - Round-robin (everyone speaks, no one dominates)
   - Silent ideation (introverts contribute equally)
   - Breakout groups (divide and conquer)
   - Energizers (quick games, stretch breaks)

   **Handling Blockers**:
   - Parking lot (defer off-topic discussions)
   - Escalation path (when team is stuck, escalate to stakeholder)
   - Time cap on debates (5 minutes max, then move on)

5. **Tools & Materials**:
   **Collaboration Tools**:
   - Whiteboard: Miro, FigJam, Excalidraw
   - Design: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
   - Documents: Notion, Google Docs, Confluence
   - Task tracking: Linear, Jira, Asana
   - Communication: Slack, Zoom, Loom

    - Team alignment (everyone on same page)

## Deliverables

- Session plan (agenda, participants, materials)
- Facilitation guide (activities, timings, decision frameworks)
- Session artifacts (designs, code, content, notes)
- Action items (owners, due dates, next steps)
- Session summary (accomplishments, decisions, learnings)

## Session Best Practices

**Energy Management**:
- Start with high-energy activity (icebreaker, warmup)
- Schedule hardest work in morning (peak mental energy)
- Take breaks every 90 minutes (prevent burnout)
- End on a high note (celebrate wins, ship something)

**Inclusion**:
- Ensure all voices heard (quiet people speak first)
- Avoid group think (individual ideation before group discussion)
- Respect different working styles (visual, verbal, kinesthetic)

**Focus**:
- One goal per session (don't try to do everything)
- No multitasking (phones off, Slack snoozed)
- Timebox activities (move fast, maintain momentum)

**Output Over Process**:
- Ship something tangible (design, code, content, decision)
- Prototype > perfect (iterate later)
- Decide quickly (analysis paralysis is worse than wrong decision)

## Success Criteria

- **Tangible output**: Something shipped (feature, prototype, content, decision)
- **Team alignment**: Everyone clear on next steps
- **High engagement**: 100% participation, no distractions
- **Time efficiency**: Accomplished in 1/4 the time of async work

**Route to**: System Coordinator → Project Management Coordinator → studio-producer
