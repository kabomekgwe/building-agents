# Build Mobile Feature

I need you to build a mobile app feature for iOS and/or Android.

## Context

**Feature Requirements**: $ARGUMENTS

**Platform**: iOS / Android / Both (specify if not mentioned)

## Your Task

Route this to the **mobile-app-builder** agent who will:

1. **Platform Design**:
   - Determine platform-specific requirements
   - Plan native integrations (camera, push notifications, etc.)
   - Design offline-first architecture if needed

2. **Implementation**:
   - Build with React Native, Flutter, or native (Swift/Kotlin)
   - Follow platform design guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
   - Implement responsive layouts for different screen sizes
   - Add platform-specific optimizations

3. **Native Features**:
   - Push notifications (if needed)
   - Biometric authentication (if needed)
   - Camera/photo library (if needed)
   - Offline data sync (if needed)

4. **Performance**:
   - 60fps animations
   - < 2s app launch time
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Handle background execution

5. **Testing**:
   - Test on iOS and Android devices
   - Handle platform-specific edge cases
   - Test offline scenarios

6. **App Store Prep** (if releasing):
   - Screenshots for app stores
   - App icon (all sizes)
   - App store description
   - Beta distribution (TestFlight/Play Console)

## Deliverables

- Working mobile app code
- Tested on physical devices
- Platform-specific builds
- Ready for app store submission (if applicable)

**Route to**: System Coordinator → Engineering Coordinator → mobile-app-builder
