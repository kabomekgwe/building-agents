# Build Feature

I need you to build a complete feature from requirements to implementation.

## Context

**Feature Request**: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Route this request through the system coordinator to the appropriate engineering specialist (frontend-developer, backend-architect, or full-stack coordination).

The specialist should:
1. **Clarify Requirements**: Ask questions if requirements are unclear
2. **Design Approach**: Plan technical implementation with architecture considerations
3. **Implement Feature**: Write production-ready code following DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles
4. **Add Tests**: Create comprehensive tests (unit, integration)
5. **Document**: Add code comments and update relevant documentation
6. **Quality Check**: Ensure code meets quality standards before completion

## Collaboration

Coordinate with:
- **ui-designer**: If UI/UX design needed
- **backend-architect**: If API or database changes required
- **qa-engineer**: For test coverage validation
- **devops-automator**: For deployment considerations

## Deliverables

- Working, tested feature code
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Ready for code review

**Route to**: System Coordinator → Engineering Coordinator → Appropriate Specialist(s)
