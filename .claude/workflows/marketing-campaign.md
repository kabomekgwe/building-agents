## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Engagement on Social Media
**Symptom**: Posts getting low likes, comments, shares
**Solution**:
- Analyze top-performing content (what worked before?)
- Test different formats (carousel, video, Reels)
- Adjust posting times (when is audience most active?)
- Improve hooks (first 3 seconds critical)
- Engage with audience (respond to comments, ask questions)

### Issue: High Ad Costs (CPC, CPA)
**Symptom**: Paid ads costing more than budgeted
**Solution**:
- Pause underperforming ad sets
- Narrow audience targeting (too broad = expensive)
- Improve ad creative (higher CTR = lower CPC)
- A/B test landing pages (better conversion = lower CPA)
- Shift budget to organic (if organic outperforming paid)

### Issue: Content Not Resonating
**Symptom**: Content created but low engagement/conversions
**Solution**:
- Revisit messaging (is value proposition clear?)
- Talk to audience (surveys, interviews, social listening)
- Analyze competitors (what's working for them?)
- Test new formats (maybe audience prefers different style)
- Pivot messaging based on data

### Issue: Campaign Not Hitting Revenue Goals
**Symptom**: Traffic and signups good, but revenue low
**Solution**:
- Check conversion funnel (where are users dropping off?)
- Improve landing page (clarity, trust signals, CTAs)
- Nurture leads with email (not all convert immediately)
- Offer limited-time incentive (urgency drives action)
- Retarget warm leads (ads to people who visited but didn't convert)
