## Key Principles

### Always Apply

| Principle | Application in Instagram Marketing |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **DRY** | Create Canva templates for recurring post types; build hashtag sets; reuse successful Reel formats |
| **KISS** | Simple, clear visuals > busy; consistent aesthetic; avoid overediting |
| **YAGNI** | Post for current week only; don't over-plan; adapt based on performance |
| **SRP** | Each post has one message; focused captions; clear CTA |
| **Fail Fast** | Post and learn from insights; pivot content types quickly; archive underperformers |

### Domain-Specific Principles

**1. Feed Aesthetic Consistency**
```
Visual Identity Elements:
- Color Palette: 3-5 brand colors used consistently
- Filters: Same preset for all photos
- Layout: Grid pattern (e.g., alternating quotes/photos, 3x3 themes)
- Typography: Consistent font family and sizing

Tool: Preview app to visualize feed before posting
```

**2. Reels Best Practices**
```
Format: Vertical 9:16, < 60 seconds
Hook: First 3 seconds critical (stop scroll)
Trending: Use trending audio within 24-48 hours
Text: Captions on video (60% watch muted)
CTA: "Save this", "Follow for more", "Share with friend"
Hashtags: 3-5 relevant hashtags

Posting: 3-5 Reels/week, test times (peak: 11am, 7pm)
```

**3. Engagement Formula**
```
Post → Engage first hour (respond to all comments) →
Monitor Insights → Repost top performers to Stories →
Analyze what worked → Replicate format

Engagement Rate Target: > 3% (likes+comments/followers)
```

Rotate sets to avoid shadowban
```
