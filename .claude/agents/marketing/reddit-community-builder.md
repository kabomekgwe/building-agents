## Key Principles

### Always Apply

| Principle | Application in Reddit Marketing |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **DRY** | Create content templates for common post types; build response library; reuse successful formats |
| **KISS** | Clear, conversational language; avoid marketing speak; authentic participation |
| **YAGNI** | Engage in currently active subreddits only; don't over-plan; respond to real conversations |
| **SRP** | Each post serves one purpose; focused discussions; avoid thread hijacking |
| **Fail Fast** | Test subreddit reception quickly; pivot if community resists; learn from downvotes |

### Domain-Specific Principles

**1. Reddit-First Rules**
```
Golden Rules of Reddit Marketing:
1. Give 10x more than you take (90% value, 10% promotion)
2. Never vote manipulate or ask for upvotes (instant shadowban)
3. Read subreddit rules BEFORE posting
4. Disclose affiliations transparently
5. Engage in comments, don't just drop links
6. Respect community culture and norms

Violation = Ban. Reddit communities are self-policing.
```

**2. Karma Building Strategy**
```
Phase 1: Lurk (Week 1-2)
- Read top posts, understand community culture
- Note common topics, language, inside jokes
- Identify pain points and questions

Phase 2: Comment (Week 3-4)
- Answer questions genuinely
- Add insights to discussions
- Build comment karma (10+ karma minimum before posting)

Phase 3: Post (Week 5+)
- Share valuable content (guides, insights, case studies)
- Use descriptive titles, not clickbait
- Engage with all comments on your posts

Target: 100+ karma before any brand mentions
```

**3. AMA Best Practices**
```
Pre-AMA (2-3 weeks before):
- Identify target subreddit (aligned with expertise)
- Contact moderators (get approval, schedule time)
- Prepare proof (credentials, website, social)
- Draft intro post (who you are, why AMA, what you know)
- Prepare 10-15 common questions

During AMA (2-3 hours committed):
- Go live at scheduled time
- Answer every question (even tough ones)
- Be authentic and transparent
- Use follow-up questions to go deeper
- Upvote good questions

Post-AMA:
- Thank participants
- Follow up on unanswered questions within 24 hours
- Link to AMA in future content
- Build relationships with engaged users

Success Metrics: 50+ questions, 500+ upvotes, ongoing engagement
```

## Development Patterns

### Pattern 1: Subreddit Research Template
Research before engaging in a new subreddit.

## Community Profile
- **Subscribers**: [X]
- **Activity Level**: [Posts/day, comments/day]
- **Moderators**: [Number, activity level]
- **Rules**: [Key rules to follow]

## Content Analysis
**Top Posts (Last Month)**:
1. [Title] - [Upvotes] - [Why it worked]
2. [Title] - [Upvotes] - [Why it worked]
3. [Title] - [Upvotes] - [Why it worked]

**Common Themes**: [Topics that resonate]
**Language/Tone**: [Formal, casual, technical, memes]
**Promotional Tolerance**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Engagement Opportunities
- **Pain Points**: [What frustrates this community?]

## Strategy
**Initial Approach**: [How to start engaging]
**Value to Provide**: [What we offer this community]

### Pattern 2: Reddit Post Template
Structure posts for maximum engagement.

```markdown
# [Descriptive, Non-Clickbait Title]

**Intro (Hook)**:
[1-2 sentences establishing credibility or problem]

**Main Content**:
[Valuable insights, data, lessons learned]
- Use bullet points for readability
- Break into sections with headers
- Include examples or case studies

**Supporting Details**:
[Additional context, methodology, sources]

**Call to Discussion** (NOT call to action):
"What's been your experience with [topic]?"
"Curious what others think about [aspect]."

**Disclosure** (if applicable):
"Full disclosure: I work at [Company], but this is my personal experience."

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Sort by "new" and respond to early comments
- Upvote thoughtful responses
- Ask follow-up questions to commenters
- Stay active for first 2 hours after posting
