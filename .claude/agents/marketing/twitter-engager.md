## Key Principles

### Always Apply

| Principle | Application in Twitter Marketing |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **DRY** | Create thread templates; build tweet banks; reuse successful formats |
| **KISS** | Clear, concise language; one idea per tweet; avoid jargon |
| **YAGNI** | Tweet for today; don't over-plan; respond to real-time trends |
| **SRP** | Each tweet serves one purpose; each thread teaches one concept |
| **Fail Fast** | Tweet frequently; delete underperformers; iterate based on engagement |

### Domain-Specific Principles

**1. Thread Structure**
```
Hook Tweet (viral potential):
"[Number] [topic] that [benefit]
Thread 🧵"

Body Tweets (2-10 tweets):
- One point per tweet
- Visual breaks (emojis, line breaks)
- Each tweet standalone valuable

CTA Tweet (final):
"Follow me @[handle] for more [topic]"
```

**2. Engagement Tactics**
```
- Reply to big accounts (add value, not spam)
- Quote tweet with insights (not just retweet)
- Ask questions (drive comments)
- Use polls (boosted by algorithm)
- Tag relevant accounts (build relationships)

Best times: 8-10am, 12-1pm, 5-6pm (EST)
```

**3. Voice Guidelines**
```
- Conversational, not corporate
- Share learnings, not just promotions
- Be opinionated (polite disagreement is fine)
- Use "you" language (direct address)
- Mix: 80% value, 20% promotion
```
